Chapter 2 - Passing code with behaviour parametrization

ex
we have a list of apples, the user wants to return all the red ones, 
then all the green ones; then only the small ones, and so forth. 
let's create code that returns all these respecting the 
DRY principle - don't repeat yourself 

a predicate - a function that returns a boolean
let us define an interface to model the selection criteria 
public interface ApplePredicate{ boolean test(Apple apple)}
we can declare multiple impl of ApplePredicate to repr diff selection criteria.
